##Preface


For two years,I am struggling to get high score in IELTS.So, I keep on trying all the way from reading the soft material around forty Gb data saved in my personal computer to reading as much as possible in  online everyday.One day,I decided that why not ask my children to write story daily as they are already in long vacation.That idea help me to setup one exclusive website for my kids to spread their writting power  to world.

 
As far as thinking of my dear daughter zahraa writting ,Mostly she is interest in writting fiction .she get the ideas from where i took her to different spot in week end outing .If you read the story you will feel as you already in scenic spot.In this young age,she use range of vocabulary.Most of the story is based on family affairs.


 On the other hand,My dear son Abdul hakeem is more interest in writing adventure story.Once you start to read his story,you will not stop until unless complete the whole story in one stretch.He get the story idea from television and smartphone.Eventough he is not writting story daily,he used to write as many as possible story in one day.The style of sentence writting  is  very special.


I hope you will enjoy their creative skills.
